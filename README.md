## How to use

A matchup must initially be selected in order to begin creating categories or adding links.

Once categories are created you simply tap on your desired category to begin adding notes to that specific matchup.

Links saved will open in the browser upon tapping. The link must be a valid link or it will fail to open. To clarify, the link itself need to be added under the "Link Text" textfield.
